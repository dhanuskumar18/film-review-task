            <h1 id="intro">STAR&#127916;</h1>
            <p><mark>CHENNAI:</mark> I thought of <q>Vaaranam Aayiram</q> many times while watching Star. It‚Äôs not just because of Kavin‚Äôs
                early looks, as Kalai, or his dance moves. There‚Äôs more. There‚Äôs a phone call he makes from an alien
                city, as he breaks down and shares his loss with his parents. Here, the death is not of a person; it‚Äôs
                of a dream. Here too, the story feels rather personal, almost autobiographical; here too, one romantic
                relationship ends, and another begins, and here too, the new girl helps heal the protagonist. Above all,
                there‚Äôs the whole ‚Äòsupportive dad‚Äô angle. The big difference, of course, is that here, Kalai doesn‚Äôt
                seem as thankful or grateful‚Äînot verbally anyway.</p><br>
            <p> In fact, if it weren‚Äôt for Kavin, if it weren‚Äôt for how Elan channels his love for our cinema with all
                those homages in the first half, Kalai would be a really hard man to root for. But I suppose this can be
                said of any man whose existence is completely dedicated to a single pursuit. I want to be a star. This
                pursuit‚Äîof not just being an actor, but a star‚Äîsurely necessitates narcissism on some level. At one
                point, his first girlfriend, Meera, asks him why he stopped being about them and turned into being all
                about himself. I wanted to ask Meera when Kalai was ever about her. He seeks not a girl or a wife, but a
                <q>heroine</q> for when he becomes a <q>hero</q>. That‚Äôs why it surprised me that Meera never gets her due from
                the film after she breaks up with him. To be fair to Elan, he does way more than a usual filmmaker will.
                He lets Meera register her love for biking. He gets the aggressive Kalai dressing up as a woman and
                blushing too. In that moment, looks be damned, he truly expresses his emotion devoid of insecurities.
                And that‚Äôs why Meera, in that moment, calls him beautiful. But Kalai is almost never like this in the
                film, as his thankless quest for money and opportunities, fills himself up with self-pity and
                bitterness.</p>

        <h3 id="review">Reviewüòç</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/img2.avif" id="img1" alt="star movie poster" height="30%" width="50%">
        <p class="rev">The cutesy beginnings of her relationship with Kalai don‚Äôt really brighten up proceedings as
            designed, and at
            one point, the character even threatens to kidnap the story from Kalai himself, as the film meanders
            post-interval and introduces us to her family situation, including drunk father‚Ñ¢ and quirky grandmother‚Ñ¢.
            However, Elan smoothens over narrative deficiencies with impressive filmmaking touches. When Kalai is
            heckled during his performance, we see him raise a guitar. And then, cut. We see the aftermath of the fight.
            In another scene, Kalai has just beaten up a bunch of seniors and when in the next scene, we see his mother
            raising a ruckus, we think it‚Äôs about the fight, but no, it‚Äôs about Meera visiting him. Or how about when
            Elan utilises a funeral scene and does enough to get you both laughing and later, being moved by the
            complexity of it all? Just after interval, there‚Äôs a lovely repetition of circular shots, as we go round and
            round seeing what Kalai once was, so we can register the misery of what he now is.</p>
        <p class="rev">Perhaps the best portion in the film is when Elan springs an absolutely beautiful surprise by
            paying homage
            to Yuvan Shankar Raja himself <i>(whose work I thoroughly enjoyed in this film)</i>. I caught myself dwelling on
            every moment of this song, singing along, finally satisfied that this lovely song now has a video. I also
            enjoyed the hints of commentary on the nature of acting in this film‚Äîon when acting becomes over-acting, on
            how life experience is crucial in order to become a better artiste‚Äîbut I wish there were a lot more of all
            of this, for 'Star', after all, is about the artform of acting. For instance, what does Kalai think of
            playing non-hero roles? Would he consider that beneath him? Would his vanity allow it? There is barely any
            exploration of these fundamental threads. If he can‚Äôt help himself, can we at least have a rare glimpse of
            his goodness? I do think the film loses direction, especially when it forces Surabhi and her family dynamics
            into the fold. She talks about how his college speech on women inspired her, and yet, not once do we ever
            see Kalai engaging meaningfully with his mother or sister. What were/are their dreams exactly? He asks this
            of an interviewer though and gets some financial assistance there‚Äîand I liked that for a man to fulfill
            selfish goals, many others need to make such unselfish contributions.</p>

        <p class="rev">For that reason, 'Star' is more likeable as a film about Kalai‚Äôs father Pandian, who too had
            acting
            aspirations but sacrificed it to raise a family instead. His goals come full circle eventually‚Äîthrough his
            son‚Äî and that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs more meaning to be drawn from the film ending with Pandian‚Äôs scene at the end.
            But Kalai is the protagonist, not Pandian. And till the end, we see him only as a man besotted with a dream,
            a man who is not quite shown to appreciate what he‚Äôs getting. It‚Äôs a film that speaks of the universe loving
            a man with a stubborn heart. But as Jim Carrey, a man who got everything that Kalai dreams of, once put it,
         <q>I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that
            it‚Äôs not the answer.</q></p>
